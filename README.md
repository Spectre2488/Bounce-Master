# Bounce-Master

Bounce Master is an addictive arcade game built in Python using the Pygame library. The game challenges players to control a paddle and bounce a ball to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle and bounce the ball.
- Three difficulty levels: Choose from easy, medium, and hard, each with varying ball speeds to suit your preference.
- High score tracking: Compete with yourself and aim for the highest score possible.

## Installation

To play Bounce Master, follow these steps:

1. Install Python (if you haven't already).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip: pip install pygame or pip3 install pygame
4. Run the game by executing the `main.py` file:


## Controls

- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
- Press 'R' to restart the game after losing.

In this game, a common bug exists related to the high score tracking. Occasionally, the high score increments multiple times when the ball touches the player, resulting in an inflated score. Additionally, there are rare occurrences of bugs where the game enters an endless loop after losing, preventing the player from starting a new game. Furthermore, in some cases, the game fails to start even after selecting the difficulty level, depriving players of the gaming experience. These issues need to be addressed to ensure consistent and smooth gameplay for all players.
